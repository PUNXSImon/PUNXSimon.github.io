				</div>
				
				<div id="description">
				The story takes place in a modern version of the World of Twelve from the Wakfu animated series/game.<br>
				In this story, the Ogrest Chaos has ended long time ago, classes and nations have evolved and changed, mostly becoming more modern
				but still keeping their old roots. 
				Everything revolves around Amakna, Brakmar,
				the 13 years long war between those two nations, and a following civil war in Brakmar that has ended just recently.
				<p>
				Each chapter tells a story of Shiel who is given a task to fulfill. <br>
				A task he's forced to do, and it has consequences that are slowly tearing his life apart.

				<p>
				Shiel was born in Brakmar. When he was 6 he moved out to Amakna together with his parents due to a war going on in Brakmar.
				This has lead to him being often disliked and bullied by Amaknian kids, who are often told how bad and awful the Brakmarians are.
				<p>
				In middle school, Shiel was acting very defensive which resulted in his isolation amongst other students. 
				He grew up detaching himself and his feelings from people around him and being to them mostly unfriendly. However, he never was a loner type and didn't want to be one. 
				There still were few people who wanted to befriend him and he gained a few acquaintances and friends, but never was able to develop a deep bond with any of them because of his trust issues.
				For a troublesome teenager that he was, he studied very hard and was getting good grades. Some kids tried to accuse him of cheating on tests but he could prove his intelligence.
				<p>
				Later in his life, he studies in an Amaknian university where he meets his love, Chalsea. 
				Right after he graduates, he decides to move back to his homeland, Brakmar. It's where he gets hired as a scientist in a newly opened laboratory, founded by the Brakmarian government.

				“We’ll find you a key role in the assault on Amakna. You’ll be my little cute pawn, Shiel” <br>
				Grace touched Shiel’s head with delicacy, then her hand wandered towards his check, <br>
				which she next took in her hand. Shiel’s cheeks turned slightly red as he could sense <br>
				Grace’s sight on his lips. He looked at hers as well, but he quickly remembered himself <br>
				and turned his head away. He had to admit to himself that Grace’s charm and her <br>
				hypnotizing eyes are hard to resist. However, he had vowed to himself to be loyal to <br>
				Chalsea and he’s not breaking that promise ever.<br>
				“Are you trying to resist me?” <br>
				“I already have someone”<br>
				“Oh, pardon me. Who would that be, that lucky person?”<br>
				“That’s none of your interest” he responded thoughtlessly. <br>
				“Excuse me?” Grace painfully grabbed Shiel by his jaw “What was that?” <br>
				“I-... I apologize, I didn’t mean it” he looked frightened into Grace’s eyes. <br>
				“I didn’t expect such a lack of respect from you. A simple apology is not enough.”<br>
				From her hand quickly grew thorns that spiked Shiel’s face. He groaned from pain <br>
				and a few trickles of blood ran down his face.<br>
				“Does that hurt?” she asked viciously.<br>
				“Y-yes… Your Grace. Please, let go…” he begged. <br>
